fix: resolve MongoDB production connection error and add deployment docs

## Problem
- App was trying to connect to localhost:27017 in production
- Caused MongooseServerSelectionError on Render deployment
- App continued running but without database functionality

## Solution
1. Updated .env.example with MongoDB Atlas configuration examples
2. Improved database initialization error handling in src/index.ts
3. Made MongoDB connection optional with graceful degradation
4. Added helpful error messages with setup instructions

## Changes

- Added: QUICK_FIX.md - 3-step guide to fix production deployment
- Added: DEPLOYMENT.md - Complete deployment walkthrough
- Added: RENDER_ENV_SETUP.md - Environment variables reference
- Added: CHANGES_SUMMARY.md - Summary of all changes

## Testing
- ✅ Build succeeds: npm run build
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ App starts locally with/without MongoDB
- ✅ Proper error messages when DB not configured

## Deployment
Follow QUICK_FIX.md to:
1. Set up free MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. Add MONGO_URI to Render environment variables
3. Redeploy and verify connection

## Breaking Changes
